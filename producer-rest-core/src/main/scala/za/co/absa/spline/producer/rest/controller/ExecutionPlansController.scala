        Saves an Execution Plan and returns its new UUID.

        In most cases, if `id` is provided by the client it will be used and returned
        to the client. However, in the future Spline server could recognize duplicated
        execution plans, in which case the method will return UUID of already existing
        execution plan. In all the future interactions with the Spline API, the client
        must use this UUID instead of the original UUID to refer the given Execution Plan.

        Payload format:

        {
          // [Optional] Global unique identifier of the execution plan. If omitted, will be generated by the server.
          id: <UUID>,

          operations: {

            // Write operation
            write: {

              id: <number>,
              // Destination URI, where the data has been written to
              outputSource: <URI>,
              // Shows if the write operation appended or replaced the data in the target destination
              append: <boolean>,
              // Array of preceding operations IDs,
