Data lineage tracking is one of the significant problems that financial institutions face when using modern big data tools. This presentation describes Spline – a data lineage tracking and visualization tool for Apache Spark. Spline captures and stores lineage information from internal Spark execution plans and visualizes it in a user-friendly manner.
