#### Updated vision and architecture
In this release we have completely revised the vision and architecture of Spline.
Starting from 0.4 release Spline has begun its journey from being a simple Spark-only lineage tracking tool towards a more generic concept - a cross-framework data lineage tracking solution. The new vision covers much broader aspects of lineage tacking, including (at certain extent) real-time monitoring, errors tracking, impact analysis and many more. Spline version 0.4.0 is the first version of that "new" Spline. It doesn't contain any brand-new features so far comparing to Spline 0.3.9, but it rather provides a brand-new background and architecture.

See [Spline 0.4.0 release notes](https://github.com/AbsaOSS/spline/releases/tag/release%2F0.4.0) for details.
