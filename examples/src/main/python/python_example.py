This is simplest example of how to track a lineage with Spline.

1. Make sure the Spline Producer instance is running. (See README.md)

2. Go to examples directory:
  cd examples

3. Build Spline Examples:
  mvn package

4. Execute `pyspark` with a Spline spark-agent-bundle corresponding to the Spark version in use:
  pyspark \
    --jars target/spline-examples-0.4.0.jar \
    --packages za.co.absa.spline:spark-agent-bundle-2.4:0.4.0 \
    --conf spline.producer.url=http://localhost:8888/producer

5. Execute the rest of this file inside PySpark.

# Enable Spline tracking:
sc._jvm.za.co.absa.spline.harvester\
    .SparkLineageInitializer.enableLineageTracking(spark._jsparkSession)

# Execute a job:
spark.read\
    .option("header", "true")\
    .option("inferschema", "true")\
    .csv("data/input/batch/wikidata.csv")\
    .write\
    .mode('overwrite')\
    .csv("data/output/batch/python-sample.csv")

# Review lineage on the Spline UI.
