## Get Spline
To get started, you need to get a minimal set of Spline's moving parts - 
a server, an admin tool and a client Web UI to see the captured lineage.

There are two ways how to do it:

#### Download prebuild Spline artifacts from the Maven repo
-   [```za.co.absa.spline:admin:0.4.0```](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/za/co/absa/spline/admin/0.4.0/)
-   [```za.co.absa.spline:rest-gateway:0.4.0```](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/za/co/absa/spline/rest-gateway/0.4.0/) (optional)
-   [```za.co.absa.spline:client-web:0.4.0```](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/za/co/absa/spline/client-web/0.4.0/) (optional)

(REST Server and Web Client modules are also available as [Docker containers](https://hub.docker.com/u/absaoss))

-or-

#### Build Spline from the source code
1.  Make sure you have JDK 8, Maven and NodeJS installed.

1.  Get and unzip the Spline source code:
    ```shell script
    wget https://github.com/AbsaOSS/spline/archive/release/0.4.0.zip
    unzip 0.4.0.zip
    ```
1.  Change the directory:
    ```shell script
    cd spline-release-0.4.0
    ```
1.  Run the Maven build:
    ```shell script
    mvn install -DskipTests
    ```

## Install ArangoDB
Spline server requires ArangoDB to run.
Please install _ArangoDB 3.5+_ according to the instructions [here](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/getting-started-installation.html)

If you prefer a Docker image there is a [Docker repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/arangodb/) as well.
```shell script
docker pull arangodb:3.5.1
```

## Create Spline database
```shell script
java -jar admin/target/admin-0.4.0.jar db-init arangodb://localhost/spline
```

## Start Spline Server
The easiest way to spin up the Spline server is to use Docker:

```shell script
docker container run \
      -e spline.database.connectionUrl=arangodb://172.17.0.1/spline \
      -p 8080:8080 \
      absaoss/spline-rest-server
```

Or you can deploy it as a WAR-file into any Java compatible Web-Container, e.g. Tomcat.
You can find a WAR-file in the Maven repo here:
[```za.co.absa.spline:rest-gateway:0.4.0```](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/za/co/absa/spline/rest-gateway/0.4.0/)

The server exposes the following REST API:
-   Producer API (`/producer/*`) 
-   Consumer API (`/consumer/*`)

... and other useful URLs:
-   Running server version information: [/about/version](http://localhost:8080/about/version)
-   Producer API Swagger documentation: [/docs/producer.html](http://localhost:8080/docs/producer.html) 
-   Consumer API Swagger documentation: [/docs/consumer.html](http://localhost:8080/docs/consumer.html) 

## Run Spline examples 
To run Spline example, download the Spline source code from GitHub and switch to the `examples` directory.     
```shell script
cd $SPLINE_PROJECT/examples
```

To run all available examples:
```shell script
mvn test -P examples
```

To run a selected example job (e.g. `Example1Job`):
```shell script
mvn test -P examples -D exampleClass=za.co.absa.spline.example.batch.Example1Job
``` 

To change the Spline Producer URL (default is http://localhost:8080/producer):
```shell script
mvn test -P examples -D spline.producer.url=http://localhost:8888/producer
```

## Run Spline UI
The easiest way to spin up the Spline Web client is to use Docker:

```shell script
docker container run \
      -e spline.consumer.url=http://172.17.0.1:8080/consumer \
      -p 9090:8080 \
      absaoss/spline-web-client
```

Or you can deploy it as a WAR-file into any Java compatible Web-Container, e.g. Tomcat.
You can find a WAR-file in the Maven repo here:
[```za.co.absa.spline:client-web:0.4.0```](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/za/co/absa/spline/client-web/0.4.0/)

## Check the result in the browser
http://localhost:9090
 
## Use spline in your application
Add a dependency on Spark Agent.
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>za.co.absa.spline</groupId>
    <artifactId>spark-agent</artifactId>
    <version>0.4.0</version>
</dependency>
```
In your spark job you have to enable spline.
```scala
// given a Spark session ...
val sparkSession: SparkSession = ???

// ... enable data lineage tracking with Spline
import za.co.absa.spline.harvester.SparkLineageInitializer._
sparkSession.enableLineageTracking()

// ... then run some Dataset computations as usual.
// Data lineage of the job will be captured and stored in the
// configured database for further visualization by Spline Web UI
```
### Properties

You also need to set some configuration properties. Spline combine these properties from several sources:
1. Hadoop config (`core-site.xml`)
2. JVM system properties
3. `spline.properties` file in the classpath

#### `spline.mode`
- **DISABLED** Lineage tracking is completely disabled and Spline is unhooked from Spark.
- **REQUIRED** If Spline fails to initialize itself (e.g. wrong configuration, no db connection etc) 
    the Spark application aborts with an error.
- **BEST_EFFORT** (default) Spline will try to initialize itself, but if fails it switches to DISABLED mode allowing 
    the Spark application to proceed normally without Lineage tracking.

#### `spline.producer.url`
- url of spline producer (part of rest gateway responsible for storing lineages in database)

Example:
```properties
spline.mode=REQUIRED
spline.producer.url=http://localhost:8080/spline
```
