The project consists of three main parts:
- Spark Agent that sits on drivers, capturing the data lineage from Spark jobs being executed by analyzing the execution plans

-   Rest Gateway, that receive the lineage data from agent and stores it in the database

-   Web UI application that visualizes the stored data lineages

Spline is aimed to be used with Spark 2.3+ but also provides limited support for Spark 2.2.
